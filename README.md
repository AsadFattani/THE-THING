### 1. Executive Summary
####  Overview: This project implements a 2D side-scrolling game inspired by the classic "Dino Game." The game uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for graphics, audio, and input handling. The main tasks included designing game mechanics, implementing player interactions, and creating a visually appealing interface.
####  Key Findings:
- Successfully implemented core game mechanics such as jumping, obstacle spawning, and collision detection.
- Integrated audio and visual elements to enhance the user experience.
- Demonstrated the use of OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
### 2. Introduction
####  Background: The "Dino Game" is a popular browser-based game that serves as a fun and engaging way to demonstrate OOP principles. This project was chosen to explore how OOP concepts can be applied to game development, focusing on modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
####  Project Objectives:
- Develop a 2D game using SFML.
- Implement game mechanics such as player movement, obstacle generation, and scoring.
- Demonstrate the use of OOP principles in a real-world application.

### 3. Project Description
####  Scope:
- Included: Player character (Dino), obstacles, scoring system, background elements, and audio effects.
- Excluded: complex animations.
####  Technical Overview:
- Tools Used: Visual Studio Code, SFML library, C++.
- Technologies: Object-Oriented Programming, SFML for graphics and audio.
### 4. Methodology
####  Approach:
- Weekly planning sessions to define milestones.
- Iterative development with regular testing and debugging.
- Agile methodology to adapt to challenges and refine features.
####  Roles and Responsibilities:
- Omer Shahid: Implemented the player character, audio and overall game logic.
- Affan Rasheed: Developed the obstacle generation, scoring system, fps system and filing.
- Asad Imran:  Background elements, restart functionality, pause functionality and ground generation
However, much of the implementation was carried out collaboratively through discussions on WhatsApp and Discord.
### 5. Project Implementation
####  Design and Structure:
- Classes: `Dino`, `Obstacle`, `Ground`, `Scores`, `SoundManager`, `GameState`.
- Game Loop: Handles input, updates game state, and renders graphics.
####  Functionalities Developed:
- Player movement and jumping mechanics.
- Dynamic obstacle spawning and collision detection.
- Scoring system with increasing difficulty.
- Background music and sound effects.
####  Challenges Faced:
- Collision Detection: Adjusting bounding boxes for accurate detection.
- Audio Integration: Synchronizing sound effects with game events.
- Performance Optimization: Managing multiple objects efficiently.
### 6. Results
####  Project Outcomes:
- Fully functional 2D game with smooth gameplay and responsive controls.
- Modular codebase demonstrating OOP principles.

####  Testing and Validation:
- Tested on multiple systems for performance and compatibility.
- Validated gameplay mechanics through feedback from other peers.
### 7. Conclusion
####  Summary of Findings: The project successfully demonstrated the application of OOP principles in game development. Key accomplishments include a modular design, engaging gameplay, and a polished user experience.
####  Final Remarks: This project provided valuable insights into game development and the practical use of OOP. Future improvements could include additional features like power-ups, multiplayer mode, and enhanced animations. This project helped us work together as a team which is necessity for a programmer on a daily basis.
